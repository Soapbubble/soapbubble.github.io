# Memory architecture
**bit** – **Bi**nary digi**t**. Smallest unit of information (you can’t read a single bit on its own though).  
**byte/octet** – `1 byte = 8 bits`. The byte is the smallest addressable unit of information.  
**RAM** – **R**andom **A**ccess **M**emory. The location where bytes are stored `:)` (seen as a consecutive sequence of bytes). All programs (i.e. the functions and variables they define) are loaded into the RAM when they are executed.  

# Variables
**variable** – name/label/identifier for a memory location; variables are useful because they allow the programmer to work with the memory without having to know the actual address in memory (the compiler will convert the identifier into an address during compilation)  
**value** – the content of a memory location; the programmer knows the meaning of the value and treats it accordingly (as an `int`, `double`, a `class` type etc.)  
**pointer** – variable having a memory address as value.  

### Examples
Let’s see how the memory could look when working with some variables.  
An `int` variable called `myVar` having value `42`, and a pointer to it, called `myPtr`  
![](/images/01-memory_vars_01.png)  

A `char` variable named `myCharVar` having value `'a'`, and a pointer to it, named `myPtr`  
![](/images/01-memory_vars_02.png)  

A `pointer to int` named `myPtr` and a `pointer to pointer to int`, named `myPtrPtr`

# Pointers
## Pointer declaration
A pointer is declared like that:
```c++
<Type> * <pointer-name> = <optional_initialization>;
```

### Some pointer declarations:
```c++
int * intPtr; // pointer to int, not initialized to any value
char * charPtr; // pointer to char, not initialized to any value;
double * doublePtr = nullptr; // pointer to double, initialized to the null value (i.e. points to no address in memory)
```

## Address of (&) operator
To get the address of a variable you can use __`&` (the address of operator)__:
```c++
int variable; // uninitialized (but the value is not relevant here)
cout << &variable; // output something like 001FFBBC
```

You can use the value returned by the `&` operator to initialize a pointer:
```c++
int * pointer = &variable; // pointer to an existing variable
```

## Dereference operator (`*`)
The dereference operator is used to access the value at the pointed location.
```c++
int intVar = 7;
int * intPtr = &intVar;
int otherVar = *intPtr; // read the pointed value and copy into the other variable
*intPtr = 11; // change the pointed value (intVar changes as well)
```

## Static initialization of a pointer
When a pointer is initialized with the address of an existing variable (that is known during compilation), it is said that the pointer is statically initialized.
```c++
int intVar = 7;
int * intPtr = &intVar; // points to the address where intVar is stored
```

## Dynamic initialization of a pointer (using `new`)
Remember, when you declare a variable in your program, like `int variable = 7;` the compiler allocates some memory for that variable (according to its type).
You can point to the address of any existing variable using the __"address of"__ operator
```c++
int * pointer = &variable; // pointer to a known variable
```
This is called _static initialization_ because the memory address of that variable is set during compilation and does not change during program execution (it is static).

But memory can also be allocated during runtime (after the program was loaded into memory and execution has started).

To allocate memory for a type during program execution, use the `new` operator:
```c++
new <type>(optional_initialization); // will return the address of a memory location, like 00F1FA016
```

### Some examples:
```c++
new int; // allocates space for an int variable, uninitialized
new int(-5); // allocates space for an int variable, initialized to -5
But this memory location is not referred by any variable in the code, so we have to save it into a variable, otherwise we cannot use it at a later time. What kind of variables can hold memory addresses? Pointers of course.
int * ptr = new int;
```

## Memory deallocation (using `delete`)
Any memory that is allocated during runtime (using `new`) has to be at some point released it can be reused (by the operating system) for other purposes.
The general form of the `delete` operator is:
```c++
delete <pointer>; // releases the memory pointed by the given pointer
```

```c++
int * p = new int; // for example p=000AB3D1
*p = 3; // everything works as usual
// ...
delete p; // the previously allocated memory has been released
```

The `delete` operator has released the memory that was pointed by the pointer.
But the value of the pointer is still that memory address, which is now invalid (it cannot be read or written anymore). 
So it is very recommended (though not mandatory) to set the pointer to NULL/nullptr after the call to delete:
```c++
p = nullptr; // since the previous memory address is no longer valid, make sure the pointer does not point to it anymore
```

## Pointer conversions
Any pointer type can be converted automatically to `void*` (which is a pointer type that can represent any other pointer type, but cannot be dereferenced). A pointer of type `void*` can be converted to another type, but only by casting it to the desired type.
```c++
void * voidPtr = nullptr;
int * intPtr = nullptr;

voidPtr = intPtr; // implicit conversion from type int* to type void*

intPtr = voidPtr; // ERROR, conversion has to be made explicit from void* to int*
intPtr = (int*)voidPtr; // OK, explicit conversion from void* to int*
```

# References
Remember that a variable is a name for a specific memory location. References make it possible to have multiple names for the same memory location, so you can think of a reference as just another name for an existing variable.

For example, let’s say that you have an `int` variable named `myVar` and a reference to it named `myVarReference`. You can visualize them in memory like that:
![](/images/03-references_01.png)  
 

As you can see, the reference is basically the same variable as the one referred, just using a different name.
For comparison, the pointer `myPtr` is at a different location in memory, it just points to the location of the `myVar` and `myVarReferences` variables.

A reference is declared using __`&` (the ampersand sign)__ after the type name:
```c++
Type & refName = existingVariable;
```

### Some examples:
```c++
int x = 9;
double y = 3.14;
int &xRef = x; // xRef is another name for x. You can use either name to refer to the same memory location
double &yRef = y; // yRef is another name for y. You can use either name to refer to the same memory location
```

References must always be initialized when declared:
```c++
int & xRef; // ERROR: what does it refer to?
int & xRef = someVariable; // OK if someVariable is an int

int x = 4;
int & xRef = x;
xRef = 7;
cout << x << " and " << xRef; // 7 and 7
```

# Arrays
An array is a sequence of values of the same type, stored in memory one after another. 
For example, you can visualize an array of 6 chars stored in memory like that:
![](/images/04-arrays_01.png)  

As you can see, the elements of the array are placed one after the other. The variable myVar only refers to the first element of the array. The other elements are accessed using an offset (index) relative to the first element.

## Array declaration
An array is created statically (i.e. memory for it is allocated during compilation) like that:
```c++
Type arrray_name[dimension] = {optional_initialization};
```

### Some examples:
```c++
int arr[3]; // an array of 3 int values, uninitialized
double complex[2] = {1.7, -3}; // an array of 2 double values, initialized
```

You can also have arrays of pointers:
```c++
int * ptrArray[4]; // an array of 4 pointers to int, uninitialized
```
When creating an array statically, its dimension has to be known at compilation time.

## Accessing the elements of an array
To access the elements of an array, use __`[]` (the indexing operator)__ to specify the offset relative to the first element of the array. The first element is offset by 0 elements relative to the first element, so indexing begins at 0.
```c++
int arr[3] = {12, 9, -8};
for (int i=0; i<3; ++i)
{
   cout << arr[i] << endl;
}
arr[0] = 2;
arr[1] = arr[0];
arr[2] = -arr[1];
```

## Dynamic initialization of arrays
The new operator can allocate memory for more than one value at a time, so it can be used to create a sequence of values in memory (just like arrays).
new returns a pointer to the first element of the array, so again a pointer is used to store that memory location.
```c++
<Type> * arrPtr = new <Type>[number_of_elements];
```

### Examples
```c++
int * arr = new int[4]; // an array of 4 int values allocated during runtime
```
